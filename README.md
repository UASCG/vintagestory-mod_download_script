# Mod Download Script for Vintage Story
This script automates mod downloads for Vintage Story. This is intended for mass downloads, e.g. when downloading a large batch of mods for the first time. Made with the intent to be used for servers, but can be used for singleplayer usage as well.

## Usage Instructions
1. Place mod_download_script.sh in the Mods directory of your Vintage Story server.
2. Create a file named modlist.txt in the same directory.
2. Copy & paste your Vintage Story ModDB mod page URLs to modlist.txt, one URL per line. Nothing else should be in the file. (see example)
3. Run mod_download_script.sh to download all the mods listed in modlist.txt.
