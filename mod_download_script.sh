# ABOUT
# This script automates mod downloads for Vintage Story. This is intended for mass downloads, e.g. when downloading a large batch of mods for the first time.
# Made with the intent to be used for servers, but can be used for singleplayer usage as well.
# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
# * Requires a modlist.txt in the same directory.
# 1. Place mod_download_script.sh in the Mods directory of your Vintage Story server.
# 2. Create a file named modlist.txt in the same directory.
# 2. Copy & paste your Vintage Story ModDB mod page URLs to modlist.txt, one URL per line. Nothing else should be in the file.
# 3. Run mod_download_script.sh to download all the mods listed in modlist.txt.
# DEFINING VARIABLES & FUNCTIONS
Count=0
CountReader=1 # Used to display an user-friendly counter.
Modlist="modlist.txt" # Change this if you want to use a different name for the modlist.
ModDB="https://mods.vintagestory.at" # Prefix for download URLs.
ModURLs=()
ModNames=()
ModGameVersions=()
AppendGameVersion=true # Default: true. Appends the game version that the mod is intended for at the end of the directory name. Set to false if you want to disable this feature.
